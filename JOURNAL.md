### **Day 1: 1 hour and one minute**
Today I experimented with the use and resistance of the H-bridge I'll be using in this project.
A1-A, A1-B, B1-A, and B1-B will be connected to the Raspberry Pi.
VCC will be connected to an external power supply.
All GNDs will be connected together.

ðŸ˜± This testing period was quite short because at some point I connected something wrong and one of the L9110S integrated circuits burned out.

So, I will try to get another this week so I can continue with this part of the project. But I will need to look more information about how to connect the raspberry py with ChatGPT to talk with it :D
